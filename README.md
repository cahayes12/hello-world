Hello, Zuko here. But you probably already know me, sort of. I'm Colleen. I humbly provide for my 3 cats, Feldspar, Kronos, and Patience, and my dog, Louie. They're all black and white I hope to start a Swedish Metal band together one day. I chase the feeling of knowing the reader's questions are quickly and completely answered.
