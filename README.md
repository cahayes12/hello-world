Tidbit, threads, thoughts

Hello, Zuko here. But you probably already know me, sort of. I'm Colleen. I humbly provide for my 3 cats, Feldspar, Kronos, and Patience, as well as Louie, my dog - they're all black and white in hopes we can start a Swedish Metal band together one day. I chase the feeling of knowing I have answered a question thoroughly and understandably.
